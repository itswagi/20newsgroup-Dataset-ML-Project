That is, this evidence\\nis the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The \\nevidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoning\\non the evidence of the senses won't help either. But Christians do reason\\nof the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is wholly\\nconsistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that the\\nevidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himself\\nto us.\\n\\nIt is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must come\\nthrough this route. There may be other senses than the physical ones\\nproviding evidence of non-physical realities.

These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence for\\nreason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impaired\\nin some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense,\\nbelief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.\\n\\nFaith, as I have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source \\nof evidence on which reason may operate. It is clear that human beings\\nhave many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, and\\nsimilarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by\\nfaith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, use\\nreason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding\\nof the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to be\\nthe most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianity\\nclaims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of the\\nbest evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.\\n\\nIf you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a while\\nand you will see rational debate aplenty.\", 'I have an Alesis HR-16 drum machine for sale.

It is NOT a \"terrorist camp\" as you and the Israelis like \\n   to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer\\n   in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....\\n\\nI would not argue that all or even most of the villages are \"terrorist\\ncamps\".  There are however some which come very close to serving that\\npurpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way\\nprior to the invasion. \\n\\n   SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\\n   the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not \\n   know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\\n   suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\\n   supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\\n   ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\\n   for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\\n   by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\\n   of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\\n   are back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\\n   an 8 year old girl just happened to be.\\n\\nSome of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as you\\ndescribe.  Not all are.  There are a large number of groups in the area,\\nbacked by various organizations, with a wide range of purposes.  Hizbollah\\nand Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be.  As to retaliation,\\nwhile mistakes may be made, that is still a far cry from indiscriminate\\nbombing, which would have produced major casualties.\\n\\n   Israel\\'s retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\\n   we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\\n   on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \\n   ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \\n   leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\\n\\nWell, here we disagree.  I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if\\nthe Lebanese gov\\'t was able to field a reliable force in the area to police\\nit and prevent further attacks.\\n\\n   This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\\n   realize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\\n   its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\\n   Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\\n   would have resulted in.  \\n\\nActually that is not clear at all.  I will agree that the death toll is no\\nlonger civilian and now primarily military though.\\n\\n   There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\\n   goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \\n   circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\\n   capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\\n   in all other parts of Lebanon.\\n\\nNo, the Syrian gov\\'t is more than happy to have Israel sink into another\\nLebanese morass.

and, as with all senses, these senses may be impaired\\nin some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. in this sense,\\nbelief in god becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.\\n\\nfaith, as i have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source \\nof evidence on which reason may operate. it is clear that human beings\\nhave many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, and\\nsimilarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by\\nfaith. religious believers in general, and christians in particular, use\\nreason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding\\nof the evidence provided by faith. science claims, with good reason, to be\\nthe most valid system for explaining the physical

small communities with kids playing soccer\\n   in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....\\n\\ni would not argue that all or even most of the villages are \"terrorist\\ncamps\".  there are however some which come very close to serving that\\npurpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way\\nprior to the invasion. \\n\\n   some young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\\n   the lebanese resistance.  even the inhabitants of the village do not \\n   know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\\n   suspect who they are and what they are up to.  these young men are\\n   supported financially by iran most of the time.  they sneak arms and\\n   ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\\n   for israeli patrols.  every time an israeli soldier is killed or injured\\n   by these traps, israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\\n   of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  once they\\n   are back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\\n   an 8 year old girl just happened to be.\\n\\nsome of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as you\\ndescribe.  not all are.  there are a large number of groups in the area,\\nbacked by various organizations, with a wide range of purposes.  hizbollah\\nand amal were two of the larger ones and may still be.  as to retaliation,\\nwhile mistakes may be made, that is still a far cry from indiscriminate\\nbombing, which would have produced major casualties.\\n\\n   israel\\'s retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\\n   we have come to accept and deal with, the lebanese resistance\\n   on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on occupying \\n   israeli soldiers until they withdraw, this is the only real \\n   leverage that they have to force israel to withdraw.\\n\\nwell, here we disagree.  i think that israel would willingly withdraw if\\nthe lebanese gov\\'t was able to field a reliable force in the area to police\\nit and prevent further attacks.\\n\\n   this is the only realistic solution, it is time for israel to\\n   realize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\\n   its northern cities has failed.  in fact it has caused much more\\n   israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of northern israel\\n   would have resulted in.  \\n\\nactually that is not clear at all.  i will agree that the death toll is no\\nlonger civilian and now primarily military though.\\n\\n   there seems to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese\\n   goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such \\n   circumstances, and now the lebanese government has proven that it is\\n   capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\\n   in all other parts of lebanon.\\n\\nno, the syrian gov\\'t is more than happy to have israel sink into another\\nlebanese morass.  i could elaborate if necessary.\\n\\n   i agree, only in the case of the isareli soldiers their killing\\n   cannot be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\\n\\nno,
