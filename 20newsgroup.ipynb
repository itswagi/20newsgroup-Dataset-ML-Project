Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try\\nrunning :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py` with and without\\nthe ``--filter`` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. topic:: Recommendation\\n\\n  When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this by\\n  setting ``remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``.

The split\nbetween the train and test set is based upon a messages posted before\nand after a specific date.\n\nThis module contains two loaders. The first one,\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`,\nreturns a list of the raw texts that can be fed to text feature\nextractors such as :class:`sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`\nwith custom parameters so as to extract feature vectors.\nThe second one, :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized`,\nreturns ready-to-use features, i.e., it is not necessary to use a feature\nextractor.\n\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\n\n    =================   ==========\n    Classes                     20\n    Samples total            18846\n    Dimensionality               1\n    Features                  text\n    =================   ==========\n\nUsage\n~~~~~\n\nThe :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function is a data\nfetching / caching functions that downloads the data archive from\nthe original `20 newsgroups website`_, extracts the archive contents\nin the ``~/scikit_learn_data/20news_home`` folder and calls the\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.load_files` on either the training or\ntesting set folder, or both of them::\n\n  >>> from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='train')\n\n  >>> from pprint import pprint\n  >>> pprint(list(newsgroups_train.target_names))\n  ['alt.atheism',\n   'comp.graphics',\n   'comp.os.ms-windows.misc',\n   'comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware',\n   'comp.sys.mac.hardware',\n   'comp.windows.x',\n   'misc.forsale',\n   'rec.autos',\n   'rec.motorcycles',\n   'rec.sport.baseball',\n   'rec.sport.hockey',\n   'sci.crypt',\n   'sci.electronics',\n   'sci.med',\n   'sci.space',\n   'soc.religion.christian',\n   'talk.politics.guns',\n   'talk.politics.mideast',\n   'talk.politics.misc',\n   'talk.religion.misc']\n\nThe real data lies in the ``filenames`` and ``target`` attributes. The target\nattribute is the integer index of the category::\n\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\n  (11314,)\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\n  (11314,)\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\n  array([ 7,  4,  4,  1, 14, 16, 13,  3,  2,  4])\n\nIt is possible to load only a sub-selection of the categories by passing the\nlist of the categories to load to the\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function::\n\n  >>> cats = ['alt.atheism', 'sci.space']\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='train', categories=cats)\n\n  >>> list(newsgroups_train.target_names)\n  ['alt.atheism', 'sci.space']\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\n  (1073,)\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\n  (1073,)\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\n  array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0])\n\nConverting text to vectors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn order to feed predictive or clustering models with the text data,\none first need to turn the text into vectors of numerical values suitable\nfor statistical analysis. This can be achieved with the utilities of the\n``sklearn.feature_extraction.text`` as demonstrated in the following\nexample that extract `TF-IDF`_ vectors of unigram tokens\nfrom a subset of 20news::\n\n  >>> from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n  >>> categories = ['alt.atheism', 'talk.religion.misc',\n  ...               'comp.graphics', 'sci.space']\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='train',\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\n  >>> vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\n  >>> vectors.shape\n  (2034, 34118)\n\nThe extracted TF-IDF vectors are very sparse, with an average of 159 non-zero\ncomponents by sample in a more than 30000-dimensional space\n(less than .5% non-zero features)::\n\n  >>> vectors.nnz / float(vectors.shape[0])\n  159.01327...\n\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized` is a function which \nreturns ready-to-use token counts features instead of file names.\n\n.. _`20 newsgroups website`: http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20Newsgroups/\n.. _`TF-IDF`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf\n\n\nFiltering text for more realistic training\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIt is easy for a classifier to overfit on particular things that appear in the\n20 Newsgroups data, such as newsgroup headers. Many classifiers achieve very\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\naren't from this window of time.\n\nFor example, let's look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\n\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='test',\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\n\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average='macro')\n  0.88213...\n\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\nyet of what's going on inside this classifier?)\n\nLet's take a look at what the most informative features are:\n\n  >>> import numpy as np\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\n  ...     feature_names = np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\n  ...\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\n\n\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\n\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\n  wrote:\"\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\n  were posting at the time.\n\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\nsame high level.\n\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\n``('headers', 'footers', 'quotes')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\n\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='test',\n  ...                                      remove=('headers', 'footers', 'quotes'),\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average='macro')\n  0.77310...\n\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\n\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='train',\n  ...                                       remove=('headers', 'footers', 'quotes'),\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\n\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average='macro')\n  0.76995...\n\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try\nrunning :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py` with and without\nthe ``--filter`` option to compare the results.\n\n.. topic:: Recommendation\n\n  When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this by\n  setting ``remove=('headers', 'footers', 'quotes')``. The F-score will be\n  lower because it is more realistic.\n\n.. topic:: Examples\n\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\n\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`\n\n"
